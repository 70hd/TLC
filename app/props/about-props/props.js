        text: `Avid surfer and chef, Andrew Johnstone and his wife Camila Fernandez founded *The Little Chihuahua* on Divisadero Street in San Francisco’s Lower Haight in 2007. The San Francisco restaurateurs stay true to their mission to provide wholesome Mexican food by offering organic ingredients where possible and sourcing quality proteins and produce from suppliers they know and trust.<br /><br />
        The whole menu is made from scratch daily. All sauces are vegan. Beans, tortillas, chips, and mixed greens are organic. The carne asada is grass-fed, salmon is sustainable, and pork and chicken are responsibly raised. There’s a wide variety of plant-based ingredients like fried plantains, wild mushrooms, tofu, and grilled veggies.`,
